Attributes
==============
Attributes makes it possible to assign metadata to functions, classes and fields.

## Syntax
The syntax for declaring an attribute is:
```
@<attribute name>(<key 1>=<value > <key 2>=<value 2> ...)
```

## Functions
The attributes for functions are placing inside the body.

## Classes
The attributes for functions are in the beginning of the class body, _before_ any field declaration.

## Fields
The attributes for a field are placed _after_ the field declaration, which spans until the next field.
